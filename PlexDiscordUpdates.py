PURPOSE

This script is meant to check your plex server, retrieve lists of
shows and movies that are in the Recently Added sections, count and
format them nicely, and then output to a message via discord webhook.

If the lists of media (one for Movies and one for TV) are longer than
discord's max message length (currently set as 4096 chars but can be changed
in the "USER OPTIONS" section below), they will be cut down to size.

i.e: If the sum of the length of both lists is over the
max length, they will each be trimmed down to half of the max size.

The script is meant to be run on a schedule (e.g. via crontab or unraid
user scripts). By default, it should be run every 24 hours, but if you
prefer to run it at a different interval, be sure to change the
lookback_period variable in the "USER OPTIONS" section below.

To get the script working with minimal configuration, you will need to change
these variables (plex_url, plex_token, webhook_url) to match your plex/discord
info; they're in the "USER OPTIONS" section below.

NOTE: Do not set the lookback_period variable to be too far back, or the list
of media may be cut off.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEPENDENCIES

This script requires:
- Python 3 (might work with Python 2 but I haven't done any testing)

Along with the Python modules for:
- PlexAPI
- dhooks
The modules can be installed by executing the command:
pip3 install plexapi dhooks

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGELOG

~ v1.1 - 2022-03-19
- Made it so that in case there are too many recently added shows/movies,
the list(s) will automatically be trimmed down to a size that can still be
sent via webhook. Before, if one or both lists were too long, the webhook
message would simply fail and not get sent.

~ v1.0 - 2022-03-17
- Initial build
